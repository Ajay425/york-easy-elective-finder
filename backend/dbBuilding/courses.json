Classes consist of a blend of slide lectures, video screenings, student presentations, and group discussion. Classes are organized thematically with weekly topics that will include combinations of the following topics: print, performance, photography, television, cinema, video, animation, systems, networks, surveillance, the body, games and play, social media, virtual worlds, simulation, ecologies, digital decay, and the postdigital. To support this topical breadth this course draws readings from a variety of disciplines that include art history, cinema and media studies, game studies, anthropology, and environmental criticism. By the end of this course students will have gained a broad understanding of the many fluid theoretical relationships between contemporary art and technology, as well as a more specific historical knowledge of key figures and objects with the new media art canon.

A special focus is placed on mutualistic and antagonistic interactions of fungi with other organisms. In labs students learn to identify major groups using traditional methods based on morphology and microscopy as well as molecular techniques; aseptic techniques for working with microorganisms; how to culture fungi on artificial media; and how to conduct bioassays for novel antibacterial metabolites produced by fungi. Labs include an experiential project in which students work collaboratively to explore the fungal microbiome of a selected host plant using metabarcoding and methods for isolating asymptomatic fungi from plant tissues.

Youth are understood in terms of their media uses and productions as learners, consumers, producers and artists across complex relations of power, discursive frameworks and dynamic experiences. Oriented toward conceptualizing \"youth,\" \"culture\" and \"media practices\" in relational, historically nuanced and culturally situated ways, we will examine and undertake qualitative youth media research with critical and reflexive theoretical and methodological tools. Our goal is to balance an understanding of hegemonic forces of commodification controlled by corporate media with emerging and changing relations in which youth collectively transform the conditions, forms and directions of their media participation.

Case studies from within and beyond Canada will be discussed, considering aspects of risk, vulnerability and resilience. Contrasting disciplinary perspectives on the critical studies of disaster will be analyzed and compared. This is a required course for students in the DEM doctoral program. In Critical Theory and Practice in DEM 1, we focus on Risk, Vulnerability, and Resilience. Disasters and emergencies have long been understood through three meta-narratives: risk, vulnerability, and resilience. In this course, we explore in depth each approach to understanding, preparing for, and responding to disasters. Material covered includes risk, vulnerability, resilience, and disaster theory; risk governance and the construction of risk in society; and introduction to types of hazards. Students will apply these concepts to real-world scenarios and contemporary events. This course is a pre-requisite of GS/DEMS 7701 3.00 Critical Theory and Practice in DEM 2: Research and Practice in Disaster and Emergency Management",

With this comes increased population density, economic disparities and increased cultural, ethic, racial and religious diversity.

Using Toronto as an example, the course begins by examining the question: What characterizes urban schools We then go on to examine the historical, social, economis and political issues in the city and investigate how the demographic changes in particular have affected the education system. What changes have occured in the teaching, professional and administrative staff of the schools in term of representation What curricula, programmatic and pedagogical changes have occured? What are the challenges and tensions that the schools face as they attempt to accomodate diverse cultures? Schools in Toronto will be investigated and used as case studies. Through urban theory, field visits and individual assignments we will investigate the extent to which schools' currucula, program and staff representatives are responsive to the needs of today's students. Special attention will be paid to the roles of educators, students and parents in helping address educational, cultural and social issues. The goal of this course, therefore, is to enable students to develop working (tentative and transitional) conceptualizations around the following essential question: how are power, knowledge, identity and cultural representation organized within the space of urban educational encounters?",

This sequence leads naturally to the notion of Revenue (the product of quantity demanded and price) where nonlinear functions are analyzed using mathematical techniques that include derivatives. This sequence culminates with notions of prices that maximize revenue subject to a given demand function. A large number of such topic sequences involving univariate functions are examined.

With this comes increased population density, economic disparities and increased cultural, ethic, racial and religious diversity. Public institutions, and schools in particular, are charged with the responsibility of addressing the resultant challenges. Using Toronto as an example, the course begins by examining the question: What characterizes urban schools We then go on to examine the historical, social, economis and political issues in the city and investigate how the demographic changes in particular have affected the education system. What changes have occured in the teaching, professional and administrative staff of the schools in term of representation What curricula, programmatic and pedagogical changes have occured? What are the challenges and tensions that the schools face as they attempt to accomodate diverse cultures? Schools in Toronto will be investigated and used as case studies. Through urban theory, field visits and individual assignments we will investigate the extent to which schools' currucula, program and staff representatives are responsive to the needs of today's students. Special attention will be paid to the roles of educators, students and parents in helping address educational, cultural and social issues. The goal of this course, therefore, is to enable students to develop working (tentative and transitional) conceptualizations around the following essential question: how are power, knowledge, identity and cultural representation organized within the space of urban educational encounters?",

They document programs with comments and preconditions. They analyze the type correctness of programs via a type checker. They use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to develop, unit-test and debug programs given a problem specification. They apply conditionals (including nested conditionals) to implement algorithms to solve computational problems. They code functions to develop modular programming solutions for computational problems. They apply Python loops (including nested loops) to implement algorithms to solve computational problems. They apply data structures, including tuples, sets, lists and dictionaries, to implement algorithms to solve computational problems. They code simple recursive functions to implement algorithms to solve computational problems.

Multilingual education will be viewed in multiple ways, incorporating internal and international responses to globalization and multiculturalism. In our world today, people live in increasingly multicultural, multilingual countries where historical concepts of belonging are under pressure to respond to current cultural realities. Technological advances of the late twentieth century have simultaneously provided people with the means to move around the globe much more easily and drawn edges of the world closer within virtual space, such that cross-global communications take place in nanoseconds.

It draws from the perspectives of social psychology, and theories of development and social change to analyze biographies, novels, films, and historical research for insight into great and not so great experiments in public pedagogy and cultural life. The course considers the appeals and pitfalls of authoritarian, charismatic, accidental, and non-authoritarian leaders and their judgments, strategies, and problems addressed. The course is designed to create a method for analyzing contradictory motives, historical processes at work, and the effects of influencing the minds and hearts of others. Three questions frame the course: how does one judge the efficacy of the appeals of ideals, values, and strategies of experiments in education? How do great and not so great educators communicate their work and goals? What factors and beliefs make an educator great or not so great?",

The course also uses the history of the modern European city to explore historical issues such as the experience of war, poverty and wealth, social reform, and the growth of cosmopolitanism and multiracialism. It explores the material space of urban development by looking at architecture, urban planning and housing. The course reflects upon current social and political issues in the modern European city, such as gentrification, popular protest and globalization. Though the course will discuss the culture and history of European cities, it focuses upon the examples of Paris and London from the mid nineteenth century to the present day. The course will explore the human experience of modern European cities, including discussions of race, gender, sexuality and class in the modern city, the physical shape of cities, and the cultural representation of city life. Particular topics covered include popular culture from café life to dancehalls; the photography of twentieth-century Paris; cosmopolitanism and the modern city; class conflicts in the city; the city on screen; fashion and postwar Paris and London; and radical movements in the city. Sources include novels such as Therèse Raquin by Emile Zola and Absolute Beginners by Colin MacInnes, the photography of Robert Frank and Roger Mayne and documents on the London Blitz. The emphasis in this course is developing skills such as analytical thinking, reading and writing.

But the critical engagement with film and media texts in the 21st century is no longer the exclusive purview of essayists in legacy media or scholars in academic contexts. Digital technologies now enable critics and scholars to write using materials that constitute their objects of study: images, text, and sounds. This course introduces BA Cinema & Media Studies students to the full contemporary spectrum of critical approaches to engaging with cinema and media arts. While enhancing critical and analytic skills and vocabulary, the course focuses on developing writing for a range of different formats including short reviews, zines, blog posts, program notes, and narration for podcasts and video essays. Students will produce a range of short format critical engagements with contemporary film and media including individual and collaborative group projects that might involve the study of media activism in communities, a public curated film program, or series of video essays and podcasts.",

    "desc": "ED/HEB 2030 and its partner, ED/HEB 3030, approach the teaching of modern and classical Jewish studies through the lens of Hebrew as a communicative-heritage language. Both involve Hebrew as the language of instruction and learning materials at the university and in the related practicum placement. HEB 2030, described in its own course outline, concentrates on the teaching of the communicative aspect of the language in curricular areas that the Jewish day-schools teach in modern Hebrew: language arts and the cycle of celebrations and commemorations that structure the Jewish year. This course, HEB 3030 concentrates on the teaching of curricular areas that rely on the heritage aspect of Hebrew, carried in the classical texts that underpin Jewish Studies: the Hebrew Bible (ancient Hebrew), biblical commentaries (ancient, medieval, and modern Hebrew), Talmudic texts (rabbinic Hebrew), Liturgy (biblical and medieval Hebrew of the prayerbook and Haggadah) and primary documents for Jewish History that arise from heritage language texts and beyond. The course familiarizes students with resources, standards, benchmarks, taxonomies, and models for the teaching of classical Hebrew texts in Jewish Studies. The seminar emphasizes informed decision-making for teaching and implementation that incorporates generative ideas, taxonomies and engaging pedagogies suitable for the given learners.",

Students enrolled in the Curatorial Placement will work together to prioritize permanent collection and programming needs and opportunities. Art storage and database updating pose an ongoing challenge as works on paper, sculptures, and paintings will need to be relocated and the overall university art storage and conservation issues addressed. Deaccession, loan and online access of the permanent collection will be an ongoing consideration. Programming of the Study Centre affords creative curatorial opportunities with students developing and realizing a class exhibition project that may be both physical (inside the study centre) and online. From first inception to realization, this exhibition project will teach art handling, project management, database maintenance, budgeting, and communication skills, alongside marketing and public outreach planning, grant writing and donation fair market appraisals. Key museological and curatorial practice readings will accompany hands-on practice. Guest leaders in museum management and off-site visits will also be scheduled. The ways in which the university collection and the Goldfarb Visual Arts Study Centre can function to promote cultural conversations on campus and beyond is the overarching goal of the course.

At the same time, it shows how electronic media in Canada are a unique product of the institutions and forces that shape Canadian society, and how the modes of representation they realize are structured within a dynamic web of local, regional, national and transnational relationships. It is particularly concerned with: i) the ways the process of development determines access to these systems and the ways in which the benefits they realize are both structured and allocated; and ii) set in this context, what might be the prerequisites and determinants for sound policy in each of these areas/fields.

Managers are literally bombarded with data (the information overload problem) and must be able to filter and assess the quality of such data before inputting into managerial decision models. The ability to evaluate the quality of data and to make generalizations from it using the principles of statistical inference are critical skills for all mangers. The second objective of the course is to show how risk and uncertainty can be incorporated into decision making using techniques such as Probability theory and Bayesian inference. The third objective to show how data is qualitatively evaluated using the principles of evidence. Managers should be adept in evaluating both the sufficiency and persuasiveness of evidence used in decision models. The fourth objective is to show students how to prepare a research proposal to address any business problem. This is obviously essential for students pursuing the major paper option, but any manager benefits from recognizing when sound methodological principles have been followed in researching a business question. Managers read and possibly rely on many research reports over their careers and it is important to be able to distinguish good research from weak research.",

This 'digital instrumental system' is tested weekly in a performative context defined by rehearsals of the Electro-Acoustic Orchestra. Design and composition of instrumental systems centre around performer or conductor gestures via sensing and new controllers, or around sounds generated by ensemble members. Topics explored include movement and gesture in electroacoustic music, sound analysis and processing, digital instrument design, and the aesthetics of interactive music/media performance practice. Interactive performance systems from the course will be presented in public concerts each term, both on York campus as well as at venues in downtown Toronto. Cross-listed with GS/MUSI 5070 3.0.",

There will be an emphasis on how theoretical understandings must underpin notions of pedagogy and classroom practice, and how practice can be interrogated in light of these theoretical frameworks. The expectation is that effective practitioners have a strong sense of what they know and how they know it, and what they are doing and why they are doing it. The general approach of the course will be exploratory rather than didactic. At all levels, learning can be thought of as research: an active construction of personal knowledge, based on formulating and testing hypotheses and, in light of an evaluation of the results, modifying one's beliefs and practices. In this spirit, we shall attempt to make connections between the reading, writing and discussion that take place in the course, and the reading, writing and discussion of the classroom setting. Class sessions will vary in format and will include discussions of the readings which are set for each week, lectures, guest presentations and work on individual and group projects.
