4014	BIOL	4070	3	Behavioural Ecology	Behavioural ecology focuses on the behavioural interactions among individuals at both the intraspecific level in natural populations and the interspecific level in natural communities. Behavioural ecology asks questions about proximate and ultimate causes of behaviour, the development of behaviour, the flexibility of behaviour and learning, the adaptive value of behaviour for survival and reproduction, and the phylogenetic relationships among diverse behavioural patterns. In an overarching sense, it considers behavioural interactions against the metric of evolutionary fitness.

More specifically, the course categorizes and studies those risks that are associated with financial markets (liquidity risk, pricing risk, credit risk, among other financial risks) as well as those risks that arise from operations of an enterprise, regulations, digital transformation, the impacts of the environment or a catastrophe (among other non-financial risks). Also, the course examines in detail the various aspects of the insurance mechanism as a route to manage some of the aforementioned risks. The course combines classical lectures with biweekly presentations by visiting risk professionals, thus immersing the students into theory and practice of modern risk management. Prerequisites: None	English	AP	1

It prepares students for mastering the technical tools economists need, and which are taught in ECON 1530 and ECON 1540. Notes: This course may not be taken by any student who has taken or is currently taking another university course in mathematics or statistics including ECON 1530 3.00 and ECON 1540 3.00. This course prepares students to take ECON 1530.	English	AP	1
4658	ECON	1530	3	Introductory Mathematical Economics I	This course presents and analyzes a sequence of basic ideas, topics and problems arising in Economics. For each idea/topic/problem relevant mathematical ideas and techniques are recalled and/or derived so as to provide a deeper understanding of the Economic issue and how it can be resolved, if necessary. The notion of Quantity Demanded is first addressed by expressing quantity demanded as a linear function of price where both the slope and intercept embed important Economics ideas. This sequence leads naturally to the notion of Revenue (the product of quantity demanded and price) where nonlinear functions are analyzed using mathematical techniques that include derivatives. This sequence culminates with notions of prices that maximize revenue subject to a given demand function. A large number of such topic sequences involving univariate functions are examined. Prerequisite: Grade 12U Advanced Functions or equivalent. Prerequisites or corequisites: AP/ECON 1000 3.00 or AP/ECON 1010 3.00, or equivalent.

4659	ECON	1540	3	Introductory Mathematical Economics II	This course extends the analysis of basic Economics ideas, topics and problems begun in AP/ECON 1530 3.00. Again, relevant mathematical ideas and techniques are recalled and/or derived so as to provide a deeper understanding of Economic issues and how they can be resolved. The issues and problems covered require functions of more than one variable for their resolution. The notion of Quantity Supplied is combined with the notion of Quantity Demanded and notions of Market Equilibrium are introduced and discussed. Equilibria are evaluated through the introduction of mathematical notions and properties of systems of equations, eventually in matrix form. A deeper understanding of theories of demand (supply) and the foundations of demand (supply) functions is developed through the introduction of mathematical notions of unconstrained and constrained optimization and linear and nonlinear programming. As in AP/ECON 1530 3.00, many topics and issues are addressed and problem framing and problem solving abilities are enhanced. Prerequisite: AP/ECON 1530 3.00 or equivalent.

4763	EDST	1000	3	What Is Education For?	While we often assume that we have answered the question of what is education for this course seeks to reconsider the many contested desires, values and aims of education. Drawing on classical and contemporary philosophy and theory we will explore how education is concerned with cultivating the human and the possibility of a common world. To wonder again about what education is for in an existential, political and ethical sense we will ask about the nature of authority, power and freedom, about what justifies and bounds our interactions in education, and about the possibility of fostering the philosophical soul.	English	ED	1

In this course, we investigate language policy, education, ecology, and hegemony in our changing world. Multilingual education will be viewed in multiple ways, incorporating internal and international responses to globalization and multiculturalism. In our world today, people live in increasingly multicultural, multilingual countries where historical concepts of belonging are under pressure to respond to current cultural realities. Technological advances of the late twentieth century have simultaneously provided people with the means to move around the globe much more easily and drawn edges of the world closer within virtual space, such that cross-global communications take place in nanoseconds.

4834	EDUC	5421	3	Discourses of Race and Racist Discourse	Paradoxically, while the social meanings attached to "race" are recognized as groundless, race persists in defining and confining identities, facilitating social cohesion, and making subjectivies that transcend time and space. The focus on discourse in this course explores this paradox. We examine connections between language and different form of knowledge - of culture, History, Anthropology - in making and sustaining race. We consider how discourses of identity and difference, culture and nature, converge with discourses of the body in multiple representations to make race, like gender, one of the most naturalized discourses of our time.	English	GS	5
4836	EDUC	5440	3	Education in Urban Contexts	Urban communities are typically spatial centres to which individuals migrate and immigrate. With this comes increased population density, economic disparities and increased cultural, ethic, racial and religious diversity. Public institutions, and schools in particular, are charged with the responsibility of addressing the resultant challenges. Using Toronto as an example, the course begins by examining the question: What characterizes urban schools We then go on to examine the historical, social, economis and political issues in the city and investigate how the demographic changes in particular have affected the education system. What changes have occured in the teaching, professional and administrative staff of the schools in term of representation What curricula, programmatic and pedagogical changes have occured? What are the challenges and tensions that the schools face as they attempt to accomodate diverse cultures? Schools in Toronto will be investigated and used as case studies. Through urban theory, field visits and individual assignments we will investigate the extent to which schools' currucula, program and staff representatives are responsive to the needs of today's students. Special attention will be paid to the roles of educators, students and parents in helping address educational, cultural and social issues. The goal of this course, therefore, is to enable students to develop working (tentative and transitional) conceptualizations around the following essential question: how are power, knowledge, identity and cultural representation organized within the space of urban educational encounters?

4896	EECS	1021	3	Object-Oriented Programming & Telemetry as Engineering Cornerstones	The objective of EECS 1021 is to expand students' understanding of computational thinking and the interfacing of engineering-relevant hardware and software by removing scaffolding that was originally in place in EECS 1011. Students are exposed and interact with the underlying concepts of modern programming using a combination of activities, including experiential laboratories, projects and interactive programming assessments. The programming language is chosen so that it is widely used in a variety of applications, is object-oriented, and is of industrial strength (Java is an example of such a language). The problems are chosen in order to expose abstract programming concepts by immersing them in relevant and engaging applications. The experiential laboratory activities incorporate discrete sensors and actuators, focused on dynamic telemetry applications that are common to all branches of engineering. Furthermore, by identifying sensors as concrete inputs and actuators as output objects, students can build event-driven software that connects events to actions. The problems are chosen with consultation with the various engineering disciplines in the School with a view of exposing how computing is used in these disciplines. Prerequisites: LE/EECS1011 3.00.

5177	ENVB	4070	3	Behavioural Ecology	Behavioural ecology focuses on the behavioural interactions among individuals at both the intraspecific level in natural populations and the interspecific level in natural communities. Behavioural ecology asks questions about proximate and ultimate causes of behaviour, the development of behaviour, the flexibility of behaviour and learning, the adaptive value of behaviour for survival and reproduction, and the phylogenetic relationships among diverse behavioural patterns. In an overarching sense, it considers behavioural interactions against the metric of evolutionary fitness. A common focus of behavioural ecologists' research is to consider how efficiently animals use their time and energy in obtaining mates and resources against measures of survival and reproductive success, including analyses of the trade-offs associated with optimizing the use of time and energy. This course explores the many behavioural contexts that are manifest in natural populations of animals. Major themes include (a) behaviours under competition, including evolutionary stable strategies, frequency dependence,and the application of game theory; (b) behavioural plasticity; (c) changing behaviours in environments of changing or complex selective pressures; (d) territorial behaviour and economic defendability; (e) sex-specific patterns of behaviour in the mating realm, including the operation of sexual selection, the phylogeny of mating systems, the mediation of challenges based in sexual conflict, and behaviourally flexible alternative mating strategies; (f) patterns of behaviour related to parenting, including mother-father conflict, parent offspring conflict, and sibling conflict; (g) both antagonistic and cooperative social behaviours, including alloparenting and the special case of social insects;and (h) communication and signaling behaviours in diverse sensory realms.

5421	FACC	6400	3	Research Methods and Statistical Inference	This course has four principal objectives. The first is to help students take a more structured and scientific approach to the evaluation of data. Managers are literally bombarded with data (the information overload problem) and must be able to filter and assess the quality of such data before inputting into managerial decision models. The ability to evaluate the quality of data and to make generalizations from it using the principles of statistical inference are critical skills for all mangers. The second objective of the course is to show how risk and uncertainty can be incorporated into decision making using techniques such as Probability theory and Bayesian inference. The third objective to show how data is qualitatively evaluated using the principles of evidence. Managers should be adept in evaluating both the sufficiency and persuasiveness of evidence used in decision models. The fourth objective is to show students how to prepare a research proposal to address any business problem. This is obviously essential for students pursuing the major paper option, but any manager benefits from recognizing when sound methodological principles have been followed in researching a business question. Managers read and possibly rely on many research reports over their careers and it is important to be able to distinguish good research from weak research.	English	GS	6

5427	FACC	6700	3	Executive Compensation	Most modern management theories posit that principal drivers of managerial behavior are executive compensation schemes. It is also a common belief that compensation schemes tied to the bottom line and stock price lead to actions more in the manager's interest than the firm's interest. This course looks at these issues and identifies best practices to strengthen corporate governance and accountability in the organization through appropriate design of executive compensation schemes. The revised course description reflects the reality that executive compensation dominates all benefits in terms of impact on accountability and governance.	English	GS	6

6196	LAL	6283	3	Education in Urban Contexts	Urban communities are typically spatial centres to which individuals migrate and immigrate. With this comes increased population density, economic disparities and increased cultural, ethic, racial and religious diversity. Public institutions, and schools in particular, are charged with the responsibility of addressing the resultant challenges. Using Toronto as an example, the course begins by examining the question: What characterizes urban schools We then go on to examine the historical, social, economis and political issues in the city and investigate how the demographic changes in particular have affected the education system. What changes have occured in the teaching, professional and administrative staff of the schools in term of representation What curricula, programmatic and pedagogical changes have occured? What are the challenges and tensions that the schools face as they attempt to accomodate diverse cultures? Schools in Toronto will be investigated and used as case studies. Through urban theory, field visits and individual assignments we will investigate the extent to which schools' currucula, program and staff representatives are responsive to the needs of today's students. Special attention will be paid to the roles of educators, students and parents in helping address educational, cultural and social issues. The goal of this course, therefore, is to enable students to develop working (tentative and transitional) conceptualizations around the following essential question: how are power, knowledge, identity and cultural representation organized within the space of urban educational encounters?	English	GS	6
6197	LAL	6290	3	Multilingual Education	The term, multilingual education, typically refers to the teaching of and through more than two languages. This means that multilingual education is concerned with language policy. Language choices and uses in education reflect social policy decisions within a multicultural or cross-cultural context. In this course, we investigate language policy, education, ecology, and hegemony in our changing world. Multilingual education will be viewed in multiple ways, incorporating internal and international responses to globalization and multiculturalism. In our world today, people live in increasingly multicultural, multilingual countries where historical concepts of belonging are under pressure to respond to current cultural realities. Technological advances of the late twentieth century have simultaneously provided people with the means to move around the globe much more easily and drawn edges of the world closer within virtual space, such that cross-global communications take place in nanoseconds. This has changed language use enormously in terms of both which languages we use most often and the media through which we communicate using these languages.	English	GS	6

6215	LLDV	3735	6	Language and Literacy Development 1	The central purposes of this course are to enable teacher candidates: (i) to understand the process of language acquisition in hearing, Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing children; (ii) to understand reading/writing processes and how these children learn to read and write; (iii) to develop knowledge about the pedagogical practices and instructional approaches that best promote language/literacy learning with Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing students. There will be an emphasis on how theoretical understandings must underpin notions of pedagogy and classroom practice, and how practice can be interrogated in light of these theoretical frameworks. The expectation is that effective practitioners have a strong sense of what they know and how they know it, and what they are doing and why they are doing it. The general approach of the course will be exploratory rather than didactic. At all levels, learning can be thought of as research: an active construction of personal knowledge, based on formulating and testing hypotheses and, in light of an evaluation of the results, modifying one's beliefs and practices. In this spirit, we shall attempt to make connections between the reading, writing and discussion that take place in the course, and the reading, writing and discussion of the classroom setting. Class sessions will vary in format and will include discussions of the readings which are set for each week, lectures, guest presentations and work on individual and group projects. NOTE: Courses in this program are part of a professional post-graduate diploma program, and are not open for registration to students outside the program. Courses are not open for auditing. Only available to students in the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Teacher Education program.	English	ED	3
6216	LLDV	3736	6	Language and Literacy Development in Deaf and Hard of Hearing Learners II	The central purposes of this course are to develop an understanding of reading and writing processes in learners with hearing loss, and to develop knowledge about the pedagogical practices and assessment/evaluation strategies that support text-based literacy development in this population. There will be an emphasis on how theoretical understandings underpin notions of pedagogy and classroom practice, and how practice can be interrogated in light of these theoretical frameworks. The expectation is that effective practitioners have a strong sense of what they know and how they know it, and what they are doing and why they are doing it. This course will provide teacher candidates with the skills and knowledge needed to provide assessment and instruction in the development of spoken language through listening, to learners who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing from preschool to school age. Information about typical child development and the impact of hearing loss on child development and school achievement will be presented. Assessment and instruction techniques will be presented and then applied during the practicum and case studies.
